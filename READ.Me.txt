# Microservices API Testing

This Postman collection covers all CRUD operations for the Student and Course microservices, along with inter-service communication tests.

## Microservices Tested

- `student-service` (Port 8081)
- `course-service` (Port 8082)
- `api-gateway` (Port 8083)

## Test Coverage

### Student Service (`/students`)
- `POST /students` → Add new student
- `GET /students` → List all students
- `GET /students/{id}` → Get student by ID
- `PUT /students/{id}` → Update student
- `DELETE /students/{id}` → Delete student
- `GET /students/courses` → Get all courses (via API Gateway)

### Course Service (`/api/courses`)
- `POST /api/courses` → Add new course
- `GET /api/courses` → List all courses
- `GET /api/courses/{id}` → Get course by ID
- `PUT /api/courses/{id}` → Update course
- `DELETE /api/courses/{id}` → Delete course

##  Notes

- JWT authentication is **disabled** for now(because the token was not getting in the postman,I have tried so many time the URL hit was working and getting responses but the token wasn't getting somehow)
- Responses tested using Postman 
- Circuit Breaker fallback tested
